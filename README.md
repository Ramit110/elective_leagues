This mod for Crusader Kings II allows rulers to form larger realms with partners of the same rank.

With two adjacent [allies](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Alliances) of the same rank, you can form a new [elective](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Feudal_elective) title of higher rank. Your co-founders give up their independence in exchange for the possibility of being elected as your successor.

League titles are [titular](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Titular_title). Since all vassals can vote in titular realms, you can invite additional members into your league after creating one.

In addition to allies, you can partner with potential allies (NAPs and close relatives) and effective allies (friends and [tributaries](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Casus_Belli#Tributary)). In all cases, opinion must be at least 26.
